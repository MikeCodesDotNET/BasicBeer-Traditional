# BasicBeer
A sample used to show off Xamarin.iOS quickly in my Forms presentation.

##Features
* Xamarin Components
* Web service calls
* NuGet packages
* Storyboard
* Super basic ViewModel 

##How to use 
When showing off Xamarin.Forms, its always nice to show a simple iOS app and how you'd complete it. This app allows you to implement the description page on stage. Its as simple as glueing together properties from the beer to controls on the view.
